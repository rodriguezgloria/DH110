# Assignment 5 - Low-Fidelity Prototype
## by Gloria Rodriguez for Digital Humanities 110 (Spring 2021)

### Brief Summary

#### Purpose
> The purpose for developing and testing the following low-fidelity prototype is to help visualize the design of features that will be employed for future use by the target user population.

#### User Personas:
> The user personas that were curated from user research have: that I have identified can be characterized by the following: desire to travel with friends, family, or just themselves, book travel experiences with specific accomodational needs, be of any age, a need for a soultion to help with finding travel experiences easily rather than struggling, can have little experience to being tech savvy in regards to navigating the website.


#### Features & Tasks:
> The tasks, navigating the travel experience description page and finding a travel experience via search query, are going to be integrated on the following low-fidelity prototype are going to be tested were developed through conducting prior user research that involves usability testing from competing websites such as Airbnb, Tripadvisor, and Expedia, facilitating a contextual inquiry of a target user, and observation notes that were written during these various methods for feature integration such as more standardization across descriptions like icons, safety, and ability to compare.

#### First Task: Navigating the travel experience description page (Green)
> **Tester’s confusion or unexpected interactions:** The user immediately was immediatelty confused because rather than typing information straight into the search bar, they directed their focus to the log-in page which was kinda unexpected since I did not expect that button to be used for anything. Therefore, because of this assumption I made it produced confusion for the user since the button did not afford anything. In addition, I realized during the proctoring the type filter is under search bar was left black which made the user confused too and I need to be more specific in what exactly which was a fault on the developing end since they were not filled in.


> **Task Completion Status:** The task involved navigating the travel experience page and being able to look for details in regards to what is included, safety, and difficulty of the task in which the user believed they were able to do so since it was intuitive and easy for them. Specifically, they liked how easy it was to apply the filters which made navigating the experience description page a lot easier for them and enabled them to book a trip easier with the structure of the experience. They also believed it was a simple one step process to book. 

#### Second Task: Finding an experience via search query (Purple)
> **Tester’s confusion or unexpected interactions:** Initially it was surpsing that the user did not click on the saved experience page like imagined, rather they went through the search query again and clicked on the description page. While they were navigating the travel experience this time around they were confused by the term 'ammenities' and suggusted that there should be an easier word that everyone can understand. When they use proceeded to the experience they understood that you can compare by location and by experience but wondered if you can pick from both location and experience compare. As they compared the selected experiences, they wanted to know if price can be included as well.
