# Assignment 3 - Contextual Inquiry 
## by Gloria Rodriguez for Digital Humanities 110 (Spring 2021)

### Design Challenge 
How do I intend to design a user-friendly web application to assist families making travel plans, more specifically experiences, easier and more inclusive when they are traveling with people who are older?

The main purpose that is driving the design of this platform is to make the process of planning a lot easier by creating standardizations that are more ubiquitous by deviating away from scrolling through descriptions that are not informative for people who are older and have pre-existing health conditions. By doing so it will fulfill the mission of helping people plan inclusive travel experiences that are safe. Initially the design was inspired by the challenge of planning for travel since the current web-applications do not have any standard descriptor criteria for experiences and instead use ambiguous warnings instead. 

Thus I hope by addressing the issues that are prevelent today I can assist families to help plan fun and safe experiences when traveling domestically or internationally. 

### Target Users 
The target users are people of all ages who make travel plans (domestically or internationally) with their families who are older or people who have other preexisting conditions that impair them from participating in travel experiences. There is no prior experience required other than intending to travel with family who face adversities due to issues beyond their control. With this web-application, the user would have an easier time planning inclusive travel experiences where everyone is able to partake without hassle. 

### Research Methods
To cultivate a better understanding of how to design a web-application that is accessible for users from all-ages - I facilitated a contextual inquiry which was conducted using an audio recorder / transcription program Otter. The contextual inquiry was conducted in 

The composition of the session can be broken down into three parts:
> 1. Background - Asked a series of background questions to help understand the target-users experience traveling with family and friends, as well as their experience with planning as well. Also I asked them how often they travel as well and their family composition. 
> 2. Observation - Took place during an activity designed for the participant to get a better understanding of what the user looks for when selecting travel experiences and how that is different between friends and family. Gathered information by taking note of facial expressions and their opinions regarding the output from the search. Also asked questions to clarify why they are doing things a specific way.
> 3. Follow-Up Questions - These questions were asked with the purpose of getting more qualitative data about their experiences when doing these activities like what can be improved and suggustions for what needs are or are not satisfied.
