# Assignment 3 - Contextual Inquiry 
## by Gloria Rodriguez for Digital Humanities 110 (Spring 2021)

### Design Challenge 
How do I intend to design a user-friendly web application to assist families making travel plans, more specifically experiences, easier and more inclusive when they are traveling with people who are older?

The main purpose that is driving the design of this platform is to make the process of planning a lot easier by creating standardizations that are more ubiquitous by deviating away from scrolling through descriptions that are not informative for people who are older and have pre-existing health conditions. By doing so it will fulfill the mission of helping people plan inclusive travel experiences that are safe. Initially the design was inspired by the challenge of planning for travel since the current web-applications do not have any standard descriptor criteria for experiences and instead use ambiguous warnings instead. 

Thus I hope by addressing the issues that are prevelent today I can assist families to help plan fun and safe experiences when traveling domestically or internationally. 

### Target Users 
The target users are people of all ages who make travel plans (domestically or internationally) with their families who are older or people who have other preexisting conditions that impair them from participating in travel experiences. There is no prior experience required other than intending to travel with family who face adversities due to issues beyond their control. With this web-application, the user would have an easier time planning inclusive travel experiences where everyone is able to partake without hassle. 

### Research Methods
To cultivate a better understanding of how to design a web-application that is accessible for users from all-ages - I facilitated a contextual inquiry which was conducted using an audio recorder / transcription program Otter. The contextual inquiry was conducted in 

The composition of the session can be broken down into three parts:
> 1. Background - Asked a series of background questions to help understand the target-users experience traveling with family and friends, as well as their experience with planning as well. Also I asked them how often they travel as well and their family composition. 
> 2. Observation - Took place during an activity designed for the participant to get a better understanding of what the user looks for when selecting travel experiences and how that is different between friends and family. Gathered information by taking note of facial expressions and their opinions regarding the output from the search. Also asked questions to clarify why they are doing things a specific way.
> 3. Follow-Up Questions - These questions were asked with the purpose of getting more qualitative data about their experiences when doing these activities like what can be improved and suggustions for what needs are or are not satisfied.

### Insights 
(1) The user found that curating an itinerary for a family vacation was took longer than making one for a vacation with friends.
> The family itinerary definetly took twice as long (10 minutes) than the friend itinerary (5 minutes) because there was more to consider like difficulty level and stamina for my parents which was not clear.  

(2) After running a search for travel experiences the descriptions varied in terms of usefulness of information since it was not consistent across all experiences
> The descriptions were satifactory in expedia but they could have been more consise when you click on the webpage that explains the experience so I dont have to scroll all they way down and read at the very end like in Airbnb. 

(3) While looking on the experience page, the user relies on a standardized structure of the way information is organized to understand the experience efficiently.
> They put information in different sections like what is included and what is no so you can know what to expect which I found very useful because it made me navigate it way better.

(4) Discovered there was a lot missing information or too much when looking for difficulty of experience and not much contextualization. 
> There was either too much information or did not offer as much information and what would be better is to include videos in addition to pictures from the experience to get a better idea of how the experience is like is it scary or is there high elevation. 

### Reflection 
While preparing for the contextual inquiry, I had a vivid vision of how I wanted to design the interface for the website to enhance the user experience. Specifically, it began with what would help me plan a family vacation to include my parents more easily however through this experience it was allowed me to understand other peoples experiences and struggles so I can better understand the user. 

The participant had prior experience traveling with her parents and siblings but they had no experience planning with them because it was usually her parents doing so. However, when they were planning a hypthetical itinerary for their parents they expressed that there was a need to change websites to search for experiences to include tham. Also, they relied a lot on a standardization of descriptions of the travel experiences rather than skimming through a series of paragraphs. It was great to know that they relied on a lot of standardizations and signifiers to get a better understanding of what the experience entails. 

Facilitating.
