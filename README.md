# Planning Accessible Travel Experiences
## by Gloria Rodriguez for Digital Humanities 110 (Spring 2021)
> **Project Description:** Planning a vacation with family is challenging when accessibility becomes a major issue in regards to booking experiences because a multitude of factors have to be considered since my parents are older and their stamina is declining. What makes it challenging is the lack of efficiency in regards to features and filters that are available on websites such as Airbnb and Tripadvisor. I want to make it easier for families and friends to plan a trip that is inclusive to everyone in their group by factoring in the uncommmon such as the altitude of the experience, the duration  and physical demand of the excursion, and warnings if they have a history of medical conditions. To accompish this I want to curate a website using UX design principles that integrates quick accessibility and user-friendliness across all age groups to help people plan an inclusive vacation where everyone is having fun and staying safe.

### Airbnb (https://www.airbnb.com)
>**Description:** Airbnb is a booking website for vacation hotels/home rentals for travelers who are visiting local or internation destinations. It also offers the option to book a variety of local experienses hosted by members of the community rather than commercialized companies so visitors can explore the area further and support the community directly. These accomodations are available across a multitude of countries in the world.

> **Overall Evaluation:** Despite having an awesome aesthetic and minimalist user-interface design because of its consistent layout and enforced standards, Airbnb fails to provide important information in regards to accessibility when searching for travel experiences. There needs to be improvement regarding the amount of visible icons, more filters to be available, and better descriptors that are easily seen to enable better efficiency. 

#### Heuristic Evaluation 
| Heuristics & Description | Heuristic Evaluation | Reccomdendation | Severity Rank |
| ---------- | ---| --- | --- |
| Visibility of System Status: The interface design should provide adaquate feedback to allow users to know what is going on. | **Supports:** Good feedback with three iterating dots across the screen and a moving circle when interface is loading. **Violations:** After clicking the search bar-the interface is completely blank.| In this case the website is completely blank, an error or any type of feedback should still be visible. | 2 |
| Match between System & Real World: The design needs to be analogous to the user's conceptual models of the world. | **Supports:** The icons indicate the types of information given in the experience. **Violations:** There are not enough icons that indicate the level of difficulty or accessibility. | Include two more icons that indicate level of difficulty and if it is accessible to people of all ages. | 3 |
| User Control & Freedom: User has flexibility to opt-in, opt-out, and customize features. | **Supports:** User is able to customize location, price, time, and language features very effeciently. **Violations:** Opt-out features are limited and cannot search unless user states specific place and dates on homepage only.| Allow users to search for experiences without specific dates set or destinations set on the homepage. | 2 |
| Consistency and Standards: Design layout and structure is maintained throughout the interface. | **Supports:** The information page of the experiences are all consistant with the same generalized headings and features. All of the buttons in the search bar are all consistent too. | To increase accessibility there may need to be an additional heading for further information. | 1 |
| Error prevention: Alerts and design that prevent problems from occuring. | **Violation:** There are no alerts when the website freezes and no warning about filling out information which is misleading. | Provide more clear feedback to prevent use from clicking the search button constantly to realize that they did not fill out the search correctly | 2 |
| Recognition rather than Recall: Avoid depending on user's memory and instead make the design intuitive. | **Supports:** Able to recognize when the experience is saved. **Violation:** The descriptions of all the experiences are not consise enough when scrolling through the options and it is difficult to recall since the icons are only visable after you click on the specific experience. | Include icons that are easier to recognize on the brief description. | 3 |
| Flexibility and Efficiency of use: Userflow must optimize interaction for the user and be easy too. | **Supports:** Hovering over the image enables more photos to be seen and the map accompanied by the search showcases where the experiences take place. **Violation:** When selecting an experience it opens a new tab rather than moving the page or a popup.| When an experience is selected give the option for more details to popup.| 2 |
| Aesthetic and Minimalist Design: Interfaces must be consise, include pertinent features and exclude irrelevent ones.| **Supports:** The overall interface is very simple and easy to navigate because there is no overwhelming features that are irrelevant. | No reccomendation because the options are consise and the design across each page and experience is consistent. | 1 |
| Helps users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors: Helpful feedback must be provided to assist with troubleshooting errors.| **Violation:** When none of the information in the search bar is filled out and the user click search it takes the user to recognize that. | Additional text to let the user know at least one of the things needs to be filled out properly. | 3 |
| Help and Documentation: Must have additional documentation to further explain errors and complete tasks. | **Supports:** The user is able to select the help button without an overwhelming amount of information to appear and gives options to search by topics as well. **Violation** Safety and Accessibility issues are difficult to get to because user has to click series of buttons. | Accessibility and Safety should be listed as an option after selecting help. | 2 |

| Match between System & Real World: The design needs to be analogous to the user's conceptual models of the world. | **Supports:** The user is able to search for experiences by geographical map or by listing. **Violation:** It comes at the expense of one another.| There needs to be a hybrid model of the two that aligns with each other. | 3 |
| User Control & Freedom: User has flexibility to opt-in, opt-out, and customize features. | **Supports:** Further customization because the user has control of what to opt-in and out of because the customizable features allow the users themselves to refine the search | No recomendation other than suggusting more filters that are more inclusive about accessibility | 2 |
