# Planning Accessible Travel Experiences
## by Gloria Rodriguez for Digital Humanities 110 (Spring 2021)
> **Project Description:** Planning a vacation with family is challenging when accessibility becomes a major issue in regards to booking experiences because a multitude of factors have to be considered since my parents are older and their stamina is declining. What makes it challenging is the lack of efficiency in regards to features and filters that are available on websites such as Airbnb and Tripadvisor. I want to make it easier for families and friends to plan a trip that is inclusive to everyone in their group by factoring in the uncommmon such as the altitude of the experience, the duration  and physical demand of the excursion, and warnings if they have a history of medical conditions. To accompish this I want to curate a website using UX design principles that integrates quick accessibility and user-friendliness across all age groups to help people plan an inclusive vacation where everyone is having fun and staying safe.
